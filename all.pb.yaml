# This playbook will generate and apply configuration to all of the devices
# The name of the playbooks are based on the platform group names used in the 
# hosts file, but that is not manditory.
# 
# There is one playbook per platform to take into account the platform
# variations. As we have defined these files all we have to do is include
# them in this file and they will be executed.
